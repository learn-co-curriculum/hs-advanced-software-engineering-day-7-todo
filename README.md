Today, we'll be learning about APIs and doing group project ideation! API stands for Application Programming Interface, and is a way we can interact with other applications and incorporate their data or services into our own apps. For this morning's ToDo: 

1. For an awesome explanation of what APIs are, check out this article from [How Stuff Works](http://money.howstuffworks.com/business-communications/how-to-leverage-an-api-for-conferencing1.htm)

2. Check out the Twitter API To-Do  - it's a great walkthrough of using the Twitter API. Don't worry if it doesn't make sense - we'll be reviewing this in depth during this morning!
